# Minimal requirements for Vercel API routes
# This is a lightweight subset for fast cold starts

# Core numerical computing
numpy==1.24.3
scipy==1.11.4

# Machine learning (required for regression algorithms)
scikit-learn==1.3.2

# Data structures
pandas==2.1.4

# Note: For production Vercel deployment, we exclude:
# - torch (too large, causes deployment size issues)
# - yfinance (not needed for API pricing)
# - h5py (not needed for API pricing)
#
# If you need NLSM or DOS algorithms (PyTorch-based),
# consider using a separate microservice or increasing Vercel limits
